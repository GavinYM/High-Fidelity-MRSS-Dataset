In the realm of minimally invasive surgery (MIS), training systems must address the complexity of procedures. Nevertheless, many existing simulators reduce soft-tissue mechanics to Maxwell or Kelvin–Voigt formulations and rely heavily on subjective ratings, which degrades haptic fidelity and constrains objective skill assessment. This paper introduces a position-based dynamics (PBD) viscoelastic lung model, integrating biomechanical data fitting constraints to enhance soft-tissue mechanics in mixed reality (MR) surgical training. Our MR platform incorporates four thoracoscopic modules, logging task-level metrics and kinematic trajectories for objective assessment. To quantify the effect of viscoelastic modeling, we perform 10 paired ablation trials under an identical task protocol. Ablation trials reveal that the viscoelastic model increases feedback force by 9.2% and total mechanical work by 21.1% compared to purely elastic models. Meanwhile, evaluations with 15 physicians demonstrate the system's ability to discriminate skill levels and improve surgical performance. Our findings underscore the system's potential for surgical education and preoperative preparation.
